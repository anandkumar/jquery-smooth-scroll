Visit [BlogSynthesis Plugin Page](http://www.blogsynthesis.com/plugins/jquery-smooth-scroll/) for more information. I will post how to add "jQuery Smooth Slider" to your blog without installing a plugin.

The plugin might not be compatible with a jQuery slider plugin or on safari browsers as many reported on the forums. Please [let me know](http://www.blogsynthesis.com/contact/) about the plugin you are using. For any support ask here: [www.wpavenue.com/help/](http://j.mp/wpavenue).

However, I have checked the plugin is working fine on Firefox, Chrome, IE and Safari for Windows.
